An implementation of several basic sorting algorithms with debug code to show how they operate.

Implemented:
Selection Sort (selectionsort.py)
Insertions Sort (insertionsort.py)
Merge Sort (mergesort.py)

These can be run from the main function within their respective py files, or through the tests.py file.

Dependencies: Python 2.7
